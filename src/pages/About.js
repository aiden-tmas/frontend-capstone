        <p className="text-body">
          This capstone is an e-commerce website. It has a homepage which
          details what types of goods are sold. It has a products page which
          renders all the products currently being sold on the site. There is a
          car page; items can be added through the general products page, or
          through the individual product page. There is also a contact page in
          which the user can contact us with questions/concerns about our
          products or our website.

          One thing that really stood out to me while completing this capstone
          was how frustrating react can be. I am turning this capstone in after
          I've had the opportunity to work with react in the devshop, and this
          has helped me to experience just how difficult and frustrating react
          can be at times haha. However, I have also seen improvement in my
          understanding of react through the devshop; thanks to the different
          obstacles I have encountered while working has helped me really start
          to love working with react, even with how utterly frustrating it can
          be at times. I have also learned the importance of stepping away from
          code and coming back to it after a break with a fresh mind. I noticed
          that this was far more productive than trying to do everything for the
          project at once, as this leads to burnout and your mind begins to lose
          focus on what you are working on.

        <p className="text-body">
          So far, my two absolute favorite languages I've encountered in my
          development journey have been Python and Javascript. I dabbled in C#
          in high school, but I remember Python more. I like Python for it's
          readability and ease of use. Python came a lot more easily to me than
          Javascript as well. I liked Javascript becuase it gave me a new
          challenge. I had never used Javascript so I was allowed to stretch my
          mind more than with Python as I have used it in the past.
